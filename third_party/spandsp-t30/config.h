/* Minimal config.h for building spandsp sources inside faxmodem.
 *
 * spandsp normally generates this with autotools. We build a few of its
 * files, and all they need from it is to be told that the platform has the
 * single-precision maths functions - otherwise floating_fudge.h defines its
 * own shims and they collide with <math.h> on any modern toolchain.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT define SPANDSP_USE_FIXED_POINT: the installed
 * <spandsp.h> says which way the library was built, and the vendored files
 * must see the modem structures exactly as the library lays them out. */
